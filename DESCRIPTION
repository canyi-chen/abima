Description: Assess whether and how a specific exposure affects the outcome of interest through intermediate variables using adaptive bootstrap. The adaptive method considers the composite structure of no mediation effect, resulting in calibrated type I error and improved statistical power. For more information, refer to He et al. (2024) <doi:10.1093/jrsssb/qkad129>.
